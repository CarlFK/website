HDMI2USB is hardware for capturing [HDMI][HDMI], [DVI][DVI] and [DisplayPort][DisplayPort] data. By capturing in high quality what is being presented locally it facilitates sharing with remote users and creates great recordings for later viewing.

The HDMI2USB hardware can also capture the [HDMI][HDMI] output from cameras.

### Digilent ATLYS Prototype Board

For developing features for the HDMI2USB system we use a [Digilent ATLYS prototype board](http://digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,400,836&Prod=ATLYS).

> The Atlys circuit board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform
> based on a Xilinx Spartan 6 LX45 FPGA. The on-board collection of high-end peripherals,
> including Gbit Ethernet, HDMI Video, 128Mbyte DDR2 memory array, audio and USB ports make
> the Atlys board an ideal host for complete digital systems built around embedded
> processors like Xilinxâ€™s MicroBlaze. Atlys is fully compatible with all Xilinx CAD tools,
> including ChipScope, EDK, and the free WebPack, so designs can be completed with no extra
> costs.
