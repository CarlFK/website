# Welcome

**Welcome to TimVideos.us!**

**TimVideos.us** is a _group_ of exciting projects which together create a system for doing both _recording and live event streaming_ for **conferences**, **meetings**, **user groups** and **other** presentations. 

We hope that, through our _projects_, the costs and expertise currently required to produce live streaming events will be reduced to near zero. We wish to develop a system where everyone has the ability to record presentations and host live remote participants across the globe.

Whether you want to work hands-on with hardware or code in a variety of languages, we have a project for you. Join the team! This information should help you explore the projects and learn how to get started.

***

## Getting Started

| <img src="https://code.timvideos.us/favicon.ico" class="favicon"> **TimVideos.us** | [(C)](https://github.com/timvideos) [(M)](https://groups.google.com/group/timvideos) [(I)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#timvideos) | Parent project. |
| [[HDMI2USB]]         | [(C)](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB) [(M)](https://groups.google.com/group/hdmi2usb?hl=en-GB) [(I)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#hdmi2usb) | HDMI2USB is hardware for capturing HDMI, DVI and DisplayPort data. By capturing in high quality what is being presented locally it facilitates sharing with remote users and creates great recording for later viewing. The HDMI2USB hardware can also capture the HDMI output from cameras. |
| [Streaming System](https://github.com/timvideos/streaming-system) | [(C)](https://github.com/timvideos/streaming-system) [(M)](https://groups.google.com/group/timvideos) [(I)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#timvideos) | Streaming-system is a comprehensive video conferencing package that allows users to set up and deploy a live streaming system. It includes a website, setup scripts and watchdog code. |
| [[voctomix]]       | [(C)](https://github.com/voc/voctomix)&nbsp;[(M)](https://groups.google.com/group/timvideos)&nbsp;[(I)](irc://irc.hackint.eu/#voctomix)  | [[voctomix]] aims to do interactive live mixing of incoming video streams, designed to meet the needs of conference recording. Designed as a flexible replacement for DVSwitch using Gstreamer and based on the original [[gst-switch]] design.  |

| <img src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/313203/file-521910805-png/Layout/images/favicon.png" class="favicon"> **flumotion**  | [(C)](https://code.flumotion.com/cgit/) [(M)](http://lists.fluendo.com/mailman/listinfo) [(I)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#fluendo) | Flumotion is an award winning streaming software created in 2006 by a group of open source developers and multimedia experts. Flumotion Streaming Software allows broadcasters and companies to stream content live and on demand in all the leading formats from a single server. | Used for live video streaming. |
| <img src="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/planet/images/gstgotchi.png" class="favicon"> **gstreamer**  | [(C)](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer) [(M)](http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/lists/) [(I)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#gstreamer) | GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The applications it supports range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface. | Used by **voctomix** and **flumotion**. |
| **axiom**  | [(C)](https://github.com/apertus-open-source-cinema) [(M)](https://www.apertus.org/mailinglists) [(I)](irc://irc.freenode.org/#apertus) | The goal of the global community-driven apertusÂ° project is to create a variety of powerful, affordable, free (in terms of liberty), sustainable and open digital cinema tools that we as filmmakers love to use. The AXIOM product line is the result of this ongoing endeavor and after successful crowd funding and receiving an EU Innovation grant is well on track to redefine the industry well beyond the DIY garages and hobbyist labs the project started in. Hollywood has discovered the AXIOM as the first chance to reclaim control of the tools and therefore cinematography. | |
